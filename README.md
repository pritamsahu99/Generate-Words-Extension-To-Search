<h4 align="left">👩‍💻 About My Project:</h4>
<p align="left">- 🔭 In this project, I have done very hard work with full concentration for acquiring new skills and technologies.
This project aims to enhance the browsing experience for users of Microsoft Edge and Chrome by providing a simple and effective solution to generate random words for search queries. It was initiated to address the challenge of earning reward points through searches on MS Edge, where finding diverse and unique search terms can be challenging. In the absence of an existing extension, this project was created to cater to the needs of users seeking an easy way to generate random words for search purposes.

🚀 Features:

Random Word Generation: The extension generates random words at the click of a button, facilitating unique search queries.
Compatible with MS Edge and Chrome: Designed to seamlessly integrate with both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome browsers.
Optimized for Reward Points: Helps users optimize their search queries to earn reward points efficiently.</p>
